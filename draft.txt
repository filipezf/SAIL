see <malleable.systems>

- download repository
-python -m model_1.th 

-comma on/off
- ,generate random pop
- z(" generate random pop")

- enter characters
- print( 2 + 3)

FAQ
# when you published this, did you consider the risk that:
 - the AI may take the world bacause of a bug or other unexpected interactions
 - the universe may tunnel to  bubble of true vacuum, OR EVEN a state of maximum suffering (anti-hedonium)

---------------------------------

Agent theory:

on the most general level the agent saves a model of possible future states of the world given the past
and uses them to choose the best action:

hierarchical abstractions of relevant sets of states generate the concepts/ words


# How this can make me rich/famous/get laid/ increase the share of my genes on the future gene pool, cure cancer, bring utopia?

understand people -> act -> profit! / get laid

using self-play the hope is to expand coverage of the situations in the dataset to cover all(most)
possible situations.
